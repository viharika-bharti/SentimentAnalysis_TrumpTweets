For this analysis, tweets were collected from multiple sources and the time considered was one year. 931,631 tweets were collected using Kaggle (historical datasets), Twitter API (recent tweets) and Twint API. Since the data is collected from multiple sources, the preliminary data exploration included getting the uniform data from all sources with the same number of variables to be considered for analysis. The variables considered are:

● Tweets - the tweet content posted by a user

● Tweet created date - date when the tweet is created

● favourites/tweets liked - number of likes the tweet received

● Location - user’s given location in the profile

● User screen name - the user’s screen name on the twitter platform.


Each variable considered for the analysis has a specific objective. “Tweets” is the main variable we are dealing with for our sentiment analysis, where we get the actual text/words of the tweet content. The other variables are considered as additional metrics needed for our project outcomes.
